# Environmental-Monitoring-System
This project involves building an environmental monitoring system using an ESP8266 microcontroller. The system reads data from various sensors to monitor gas levels, temperature, humidity, and dust concentration. The collected data is displayed on an LCD and sent to the ThingSpeak platform for remote monitoring and analysis.
